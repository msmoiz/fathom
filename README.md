# Fathom

*Making the unknowable known.* Fathom is a modest interpreter for the infamous Brainfuck language. It is built to match the broad specs defined [here](https://github.com/brain-lang/brainfuck/blob/master/brainfuck.md) and has been tested on the Hello World! example [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).
